        <h3>A Day in the Life of Cheeto</h3>
        <p>
            While your lazy-ass dog is probably snoozing at 5:00 AM, Cheeto has already started his day. Living on the
            west coast can be difficult for a 'wolf of wallstreet' type such as Cheeto due to timezone differences, but
            he makes it work.

        <p>
            Last year alone, Cheeto raked in over $3 Billion in revenue trading publicly on the stock market. As
            mentioned before, Cheeto exemplifies all the qualities of a 'wolf of wallstreet' type-person, but did you
            know that the movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio was actually based on him? That is a true fact. Using
            strategic research Cheeto was able to get in on the ground floor of some of today's most succesful
            corporations. He was a key investor in Uber, Amazon.com, Apple, Tesla, and not to mention escherTalks,
            Forbes ranked #1 fastest growing social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cheeto's life isn't all about the numbers though, he's a man who can appreciate a little alone time. And
            while his stamina may not be too impressive, Cheeto still enjoys long walks on open beaches and local
            trails.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cheeto lives a luxurious and simultaniously private lifestyle. He does not like to share his vast wealth
            with his owners, which has sparked some internal conflict in recent years. You can't find him on any social
            media except for LinkedIn and Indeed.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            So there you have it, what it's like to be Cheeto, business mogul extraordinaire.
