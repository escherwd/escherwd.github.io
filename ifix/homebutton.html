        Living without a working home button is next to impossible, after all, it's one of only 4 buttons on your phone. Installing a new home button is inexpensive and quick.

      <strong>TOUCH ID HOME BUTTONS</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Chai phrases this issue very clearly on <a style="color:#60C1EB" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/164682/About+the+touch+id+sensor#answer164738">iFixIt.com</a>:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#70B240"><em>
      "It is impossible to replace the home button assembly and preserve Touch ID function. The sensor is designed to be secure and it is uniquely paired with each CPU. You can't extract the key from the sensor or the CPU because they are designed to take the key to their graves. Reprogramming them is unlikely—even for Apple. They have never offered to replace the button and likely never will. (Update: They do now.)<br><br>
      So if the device is under warranty, leave it to Apple. If the sensor is replaced by you or damaged, you will lose Touch ID forever."
    </em></p>
    <p>
      This is basically saying that only Apple has the power to replace Touch ID buttons. I can replace them, but they won't read fingerprints anymore.

      <p>Remember when home button stickers were all the rage? I don't. Anyways, the stickers would often fall off, and (in my opinion) didn't even look that good. When you replace your home button, you can find custom ones that add the perfect amount of subtlety to your phone. You can even make your iPhone 5 look like an SE or 5s with a fake Touch ID home button.</p>
